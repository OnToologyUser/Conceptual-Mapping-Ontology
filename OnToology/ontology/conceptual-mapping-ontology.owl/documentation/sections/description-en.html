<span class="markdown">
  The Conceptual Mappings ontology has two sections which are denoted as Statement
  Map and Data Source. It reuses the Data Catalog (dcat) Ontology and the Web of
  Things Security (wot) Ontology for some concepts in the Data Source section. It
  also reuses rdf and owl classes and properties in order to represent evaluable
  expressions and statement maps in the Statement Map section. Additionally
  predefined values for certain properties are represented using the Simple
  Knowledge Organization (skos) vocabulary.
</span>
<ul>
<li><b>Statement Map:</b><p>The central class of this section is the StatementMap
  that represents a rule that defines for a triple its subject (hasSubject),
  predicate (hasPredicate), and its object (hasObject). It also specifies the
  object datatype (hasDatatype) and language (hasLanguage) and an assigned named
  graph (hasNamedGraph) if applicable. A statement map refers an ontology (Ontology)
  that can define shapes (shapes) for its restrictions.</p>

<p>Statement maps are similar to RDF statements as both are comprised by a subject,
  predicate and object. In statement maps, objects are resources (ResourceMap),
  and subjects and predicates are more specifically, certain subclasses of the
  resource map: predicates are reference node maps (ReferenceNodeMap) that represent
  resources with an IRI, i.e. ontology properties. Subjects are node maps (nodeMap)
  which may be blank nodes (BlankNode) or also reference nodes. An object may be
  a literal (LiteralMap), a blank node, a container (ContainerMap) or a collection
  that defines a list (ListMap). The language is expressed as a literal and the
  datatype is also a resource with an URI, i.e. a reference node map.</p>

<p>Resource maps are expressed with an evaluable expression (EvaluableExpression)
  that may be a constant value (Constant), a data field (DataField) that belongs
  to some data source fragment (belongsToFrame, this will be explained in more
  detail in the Data Source section) or a function expression (FunctionExpression)
  where the function name (hasFuntionName) is taken from a set of predefined names
  that are organized as a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). Recursion
  in this function expression is represented through its input (hasInput) as an
  expression list (ExpressionList). The expression list may be a nested list and
  has been represented as a subclass of rdf lists (rdf:List) and where the properties
  (rdf:first) and (rdf:rest) have been reused.</p>

<p>A special case of a statement map is a conditional statement map (ConditionalStatementMap),
  a statement map that must satisfy a condition for the triples to be generated.
  The condition (hasBooleanCondition) is a function expression. Another class is
  a linking map (LinkingMap) that links subjects from a source (source) and a target
  (target) statement map, i.e. two data sources are linked and triples are generated
  if a linking condition is satisfied; similarly to the conditional statement map,
  this condition is represented as a function expression.</p>


<li><b>Data Source:</b>
<p> A data source (DataSource) describes the data that will be mapped to a KG using
  the rules that have been defined. For this section the  Data Catalog (DCAT)
  vocabulary  has been reused. A data source is a subclass of the dcat:Distribution
  class that is a  specific representation of a dataset (dcat:Dataset) which is
  defined as ''data encoded in a certain structure such as lists, tables and databases''.
  A source can be a streaming source (StreamSource) that continously generates data,
  a synchronous source (SynchronousSource) or an asynchronous source (AsynchronousSource).
  Asynchronous sources in turn can be event sources (EventSource) or periodic sources
  (PeriodicSource). Details of the data source access are represented with the data
  acces service class (dataAccessService) that in turn is a subclass of dcat:DataService;
  this class represents a collection of operations that provides access to one or more
  datasets or data processing functions, i.e. a description on how the data is accessed
  and retrieved. The data access service optionally has a security scheme and an access
  protocol.</p>

<p> Data properties in the dcat:Dataset, dcat:Distribution and dcat:DataService classes
  may be reused according to the features that may be represented in each mapping language,
  e.g. endpoint description (dcat:endpointDescription), endpoint URL (dcat:endpointURL),
  access URL (dcat:accessURL). Some of these data properties are descriptive and provenance
  attributes. A data acess service is related to a security scheme. The class wot:SecurityScheme
  fom the Web of Things (wot) ontology has been reused; this class has different types of
  security schemes as subclasses and includes properties to specify the infomration on
  the scheme, e.g. the encryptionalgorithm, the format of the authentication information,
  the location of the authenticatiob information. The security protocol (hasProtocol)
  has as set of predefined values that have been organized as a SKOS.</p>

<p>In order to express the fragments of data that are referenced (hasFrame) in a
  statement map, the class Frame has been defined. A frame can be a source frame
  (base case) or a combined frame. A source frame (SourceFrame) corresponds to a
  data source (hasDataSource) and defines which is the data in the source that is
  retrieved ahd how is fragmented (expression), i.e. a JSONPath or XPath or a
  query (among others) can be expressed in "expression" ; it may be related to another
  source frame (hasNestedFrame), e.g. a frame is accessed firstly with a SPARQL query,
  and their results as a CSV file with "hasNestedFrame". A combined frame (CombinedFrame)
  may be a union (UnionCombination), a cartesian product (CartessianProductCombination)
  or a join combination (JoinCombination). A fragment may refer to many data fields
  (hasField); this property is the inverse property of the property belongsToFrame
  mentioned in the previous Data Source ontology section.</p>

<h3>3.1 Examples<span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">index</a></span></h3>
  <span class="markdown">
  The following examples illustrate the representation of mappings using the concepts defined in the ontology:

  The first example refers to a data source frame that contains location data
  such as latitude, longitude and city. This frame or fragment of data belongs
  to a synchronous source that is a csv file with ''File'' protocol. The endpoint
  url and media type are specified; it has no security scheme.
</span>

<pre>
## Location data
ex:Frame1 a cm:SourceFrame ;
    cm:hasField ex:csvlat ;
    cm:hasField ex:csvlong ;
    cm:hasField ex:csvcity ;
    cm:hasDataSource [ a cm:SynchronousSource ;
        dcat:mediaType "text/csv" ;
        dcat:accessService [
            cm:hasProtocol skos:File;
            dcat:endpointURL "file:///example/path/Location.csv" ;
            cm:hasSecurityScheme [
                a wotsec:NoSecurityScheme;
            ] ;
        ] ;
    ] .

ex:csvlat a cm:DataField ; cm:field "latitude" .
ex:csvlong a cm:DataField ; cm:field "longitude" .
ex:csvcity a cm:DataField; cm:field "city" .
</pre>

<span class="markdown"> The following statement maps retrieve the data that was
  specified in the source frame defined previously, ex:Frame1. Its subject, ex:SubjectRes1
  is a reference node map, i.e. an RDF resource with an URI, and it is a concatenation
  of a list of input parameters: the URI prefix, the latitude, a ''-'' and the longitude.
  The firs statement map, ex:Statement1, defines indicate the class the subject belongs
  to, ex:Location. Similarly, ex:Statement2 and ex:Statement3 indicate the latitude and
  longitude with the predicates ex:lat and ex:long respectively, each one with a DataField
  as object, ex:csvlat and ex:csvlong.

<pre>
ex:SubjectRes1 a cm:ReferenceNodeMap ;
    cm:hasEvaluableExpression [
        cm:hasFunctionName skos-function-name:Concatenate ;
        cm:hasInput ( [ cm:returns "http://loc.example.com/latlong/" ]  ex:csvlat [ cm:returns "-" ] ex:csvlong ) .
        ] .

ex:Statement2 a cm:StatementMap ;
    cm:hasFrame ex:Frame1 ;
    cm:subject ex:SubjectRes1 ;
    cm:predicate [
        cm:hasEvaluableExpression [ cm:returns rdf:type ]
    ] ;
    cm:object [

    cm:object [
        cm:hasEvaluableExpression ex:csvlong
    ] .
</pre>

<span class="markdown"> Another example deals with Venue data a json available in the web. There
  is a data frame to represent a fragment of this data that contains the venue's city,
  country and continent. The statement map defines the rule to generate the triples
  that state that a certain instance belongs to the class ex:City (rdf:type). The subject
  is the concatenation of the  URI prefix and the city field that belongs to the data frame.
</span>

<pre>
## Venue data
ex:Frame2 a cm:SourceFrame ;
    cm:expression "$.venue[*]" ;
    cm:hasField ex:jsoncity ;
    cm:hasField ex:jsoncountry ;
    cm:hasField ex:jsoncontinent ;
    cm:hasDataSource [ a cm:SynchronousSource ;
        dcat:mediaType "text/json" ;
        dcat:accessService [
            cm:hasProtocol skos:URL;
            dcat:endpointURL "http://example.com/Venue.json" ;
            cm:hasSecurityScheme [
                a wotsec:NoSecurityScheme;
            ] ;
    ] .

ex:jsoncity a cm:DataField; cm:field "location.city" .
ex:jsoncountry a cm:DataField; cm:field "location.country" .
ex:jsoncontinent a cm:DataField; cm:field "location.continent"  .

ex:SubjectRes2 a cm:ReferenceNodeMap ;
    cm:hasEvaluableExpression [
        cm:hasFunctionName skos:Concatenate ;
        cm:hasInput ( [ cm:returns "http://loc.example.com/city/" ] [ cm:field "location.city" ] ) .
    ] .

ex:Statement4 a cm:StatementMap ;
    cm:hasFrame ex:Frame2 ;
    cm:subject ex:SubjectRes2 ;
    cm:predicate [
        cm:hasEvaluableExpression [ cm:returns rdf:type; ]
    ] ;
    cm:object [
        cm:hasEvaluableExpression  [ cm:returns ex:City; ]
    ] .
</pre>

<span class="markdown"> The subjects defined for each frame can be linked using a
  LinkingMap, as the following example shows. The linking map performs a link between
  the subject from ex:Statement4 (ex:SubjectRes1) to the subject from ex:Statement4
  (ex:SubjectRes2) with the property ex:latlong. The condition to form the link is
  performed with an equal function defined in the SKOS, to match two fields, ex:jsoncity
  and ex:csvcity.
</span>

<pre>
ex:LinkExp1 a cm:LinkingExpression ;
    cm:source ex:Statement4 ;
    cm:target ex:Statement1 ;
    cm:property ex:latlong ;
    cm:hasBooleanCondition [
        cm:functionName skosfun:equal ;
        cm:hasInput ( ex:jsoncity ex:csvcity )
] .
</pre>
