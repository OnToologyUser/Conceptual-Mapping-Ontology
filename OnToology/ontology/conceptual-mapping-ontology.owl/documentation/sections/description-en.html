<span class="markdown">
  The vocabulary can be divided in four parts: Data source and access, rule set,
  evaluable expression and provenance.
</span>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data source and access:</b> Provides the definition of the source data
    (DataSource class), its formats (subclasses TabularSource, TreeSource, GraphSource,
    and TextSource), ways to synchronize (subclasses EventSource, SynchronousSource
    and AsynchronousSource) and how to access the data (DataAccess class). Moreover,
    if these classes and their respective properties are not sufficient to describe
    the data retrieval, the class Argument enable the definition of more features.
  </li>
  <li><b>Rule set:</b> Defines the sets of subject, predicate and objects described
    in the mapping (ConceptualMapping class). Each rule set (RuleSet class) contains
    one single subject (with the hasSubject property) and several rules (Rule class).
    The rule defines the predicate (hasPredicate property), whereas the object
    can be described by any of its subclasses (DataPropertyRule, ObjectPropertyRule
    and LinkingRule classes, with the hasObject property). The datatype can be
    specified for DataPropertyRule (hasDataType property), and the language only
    for the class StringPropertyRule (haslanguage property). Finally, the union
    between two rule sets can be specified with the LinkingRule class, and
    the expression that links them with the linkingExpression property.
  </li>
  <li><b>Evaluable expression:</b> Allows the specification of different types of
    values for subjects, predicates, objects and linking expressions. The
    EvaluableExpression class inherits from the RDF lists to be able to expect
    more than one evaluable expressions. These can be references to data source
    (DataSource subclass), constant values (Constant subclass), a concatenation
    of evaluable expressions (Concatenate subclass) or linking expressions
    (LinkingExpression subclass). The subclasses can be extended to more functions
    necessary to describe the data.
  </li>
  <li><b>Provenance:</b> It defines the ontologies (Ontology class) used to write
    the mapping (ConceptualMapping class).
  </li>
</ul>
